                                    **An introduction to Customer Churn Prediction using Pycaret**

**What is Customer Churning and why is it important to track for any business?**

For a business in a stipulated period of time, customers can come under 3 major categories-
a) Newly Acquired Customers
b) Existing Customers
c) Churned Customers

Churned Customers are those who have decided to end their relationship with their existing company. It can happen because of variety of reasons like-
a) Bad customer Service
b) Bad Onbording
c) Lack of Ongoing Customer Success

Churned Customers means a direct loss of Marketing Acquisition Cost and possible revenue which could be capitalized post sale. Hence, predicting possible customers who can churn beforehand can help us save this loss.
